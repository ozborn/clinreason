# Clinical Context Ontology

Description: Open ontology for tracking the clinical context of a patient including treatment rationale, diagnostic reasoning and issues related to care context. The goal is to capture clinical context around a patient's care, including the clinicianâ€™s interpretations and decisions which are not well represented in the problem focused EHR or other ontologies such as SNOMED CT. For more details, see [the publication ](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/27/11/1648/5906104)

This ontology is currently under development and will be submited to the OBO foundry.
